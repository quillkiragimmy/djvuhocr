# Why another djvuocr script? #
I can't find any script makes use of the hOCR outputed by Tesseract. the lack of text positioning can be lethal when it comes to annotation & searching & indexing. Therefore this dirty script. :)

# What does it do? #
it embeds hOCR ( OCR with text alignment ) generated texts into Djvu files.
* multi-thread is supported.
* page ranging supported.

# Dependency #
1. DjvuLibre
2. Tesseract
