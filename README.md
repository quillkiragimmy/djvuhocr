## Why another djvuocr script? ##
I can't find any working script that makes use of the hOCR data generated by Tesseract. The lack of text positioning can be lethal when it comes to annotation & searching & indexing, therefore this dirty script. :)

## What does it do? ##
It embeds hOCR ( OCR with text alignment ) texts into Djvu files.
* multi-thread is supported.
* page ranging is supported.

## Dependency ##
* DjvuLibre
* Tesseract ( and its data files )
